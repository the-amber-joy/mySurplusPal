# My Surplus Pal
It always bugged me when MyFitnessPal would make any surplus calories I logged into big red numbers. Sometimes I eat more on purpose; there's no reason to feel bad about that!

This Chrome extension turns those extra calories into bonus points, and turns the red bar on the MyFitnessPal main page to green, because I don't like to feel as if I'm being shamed for eating.
