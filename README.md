# My Surplus Pal
It always bugged me when MyFitnessPal would make any surplus calories I logged into big red numbers. Sometimes I'm only over by 5 calories; that's still a WIN in my book! Sometimes I eat more calories on purpose during a refeed; there's no reason to feel bad about that!

This Chrome extension turns those extra calories into "bonus points,", because I don't like to feel as if I'm being shamed for eating.
