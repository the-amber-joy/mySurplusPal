Background: I made this when I was hard at work cutting weight for a powerlifting meet where I needed to be 2 weight classes below where I had been. I am much more competitive in the 57kg class than 72kg!

It always bugged me when MyFitnessPal would make any surplus calories I logged into big red numbers. Sometimes I'm only over by 5 calories; that's still a WIN in my book! Sometimes I eat more calories on purpose during a refeed; there's no reason to feel bad about that!

This Chrome extension turns those extra calories into "bonus points," because I don't like to feel as if I'm being shamed for eating.
